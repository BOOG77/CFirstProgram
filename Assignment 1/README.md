Objective:

Create a C program that simulates a basic Student Grades Management System. This system will allow the user to:

    Input and validate data (names, grades).
    Perform arithmetic operations (average, total).
    Make decisions based on conditions (e.g., pass/fail).
    Implement loops to process multiple students.
    Use different data types (integers, floats, chars) effectively.


Simple student management system, begins with having you create a student; enter a name, then grades for 3 subjects. Then it displays their name, their total marks, the student's grade average, and whether or not they passed the course.
Then you are prompted with the option "Do you want to add another student? 1 for Yes 2 for No", if yes is selected you repeat the previous process and add another student to the grade totals.
If no is selected you are displayed how many students you had entered, and the average grades for the entire pool of students entered.
